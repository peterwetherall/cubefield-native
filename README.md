# cubefield-native
A re-make of the classic browser game Cubefield, using [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/).

**Demo:** [https://peterwetherall.github.io/cubefield-native/](https://peterwetherall.github.io/cubefield-native/)

### Bugs 🐛

- The algorithm that handles collision-detection is not perfect, so if you clip the back corner of a cube you won't necessarily "die".
